We do brute force for password. Then when we login, we observe that in cookie, our session id is hash of our username inverted. So we change cookie by changing user to admin and session id to hash of nimda which is reverse of admin. Then we reload the page. We get new page asking for secret. Now when we try to check image in admin's account (/1.jpg, /2.jpg etc.), we see pictures of mangoes. So we try secrey key as alphonso and get the flag.
